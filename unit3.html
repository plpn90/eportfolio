              <h4>
                What factors determine whether a programming language is secure
                or not?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Programming languages are characterized through a variety of
                security attributes, each influenced by pitfalls and highlights
                of their predecessors or last-gen languages. Rust, for example,
                is widely recognised within the programming community for its
                robust memory safety mechanisms. This is primarily attributed to
                its borrow-checker, a feature that enforces strict memory
                ownership rules by ensuring that a resource's lifecycle is
                managed by only one entity at a time, though it allows to
                transfer ownership between entities (Blandy et al 2018). This
                mitigates the risks related to memory access and data races.
              </p>

              <p>
                In contrast, many other programming languages emphasise garbage
                collection as a core security feature. Garbage collection
                automates memory management, thereby reducing the chance of
                memory leaks and the likelihood of memory exhaustion (Putten et
                al 2022), which are common vulnerabilities in manual memory
                management paradigms.
              </p>

              <p>
                At a foundational level, type-safety is a must to programming
                language security. Type-safety acts as a contractual framework
                enforced by the compiler, ensuring that operations within the
                application adhere strictly to predefined data types. Type
                safety therefore contrasts sharply with dynamic programming
                languages, where flexible type handling can introduce
                vulnerabilities and runtime errors if not managed carefully
                (Chess et al 2007).
              </p>

              <p>
                In addition to type safety, static analysis plays a crucial role
                in verifying the logical correctness of a program. Static
                analysis involves examining the source code without executing
                it, allowing for the early detection of potential errors and
                vulnerabilities (Chess et al 2007).
              </p>

              <h4>Could Python be classed as a secure language?</h4>
              <p>
                Python is a dynamically typed language, making it vulnerable to
                runtime exceptions when functions are executed with incorrect
                parameter types. While the use of type annotations and static
                analysis tools offers useful feedback for ensuring correct type
                usage, their effectiveness shrinks when dealing with third-party
                libraries that lack type annotations. Even though Python's
                standard library is robust, mature, and well-maintained - which
                is critical to mitigate potential security concerns - I would
                not classify Python as a secure programming language.
              </p>

              <h4>
                Would Python be a better language to create operating systems
                than C?
              </h4>
              <p>
                Python offers convenience through multiple layers of
                abstraction, however, many of those abstractions are not
                designed for performance, and hence not suitable for developing
                operating systems. Additionally, as an interpreted language,
                Python itself can not be run natively, which is necessary for a
                system programming language.
