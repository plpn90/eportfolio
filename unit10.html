                Security in computing offers various solutions to ensure
                privacy, but ultimately, the end-user must decide to trust the
                counter-party, whether it is a banking platform or the operating
                system on your computer. Trusting the wrong entity can
                compromise any security measure. This is particularly true for
                software installed on your machine. Everyone has experienced the
                notification for an update after opening a standard application.
                Given that these applications communicate with servers, how can
                we ensure that no sensitive information is disclosed (Capizzi et
                al., 2008)?
              </p>

              <p>
                Research has explored solutions to conceal sensitive data from
                applications without the user's knowledge. Secure
                multi-execution (also known as shadow execution) is one approach
                (Schmitz et al., 2018). The term
                <i>“secure multi-execution”</i> lacks a strict definition, but
                it generally refers to running a (partially) untrusted
                application in two separate modes simultaneously: the public
                mode and the private mode. The public mode operates with active
                internet connectivity but has no access to sensitive
                information. In contrast, the private mode, while lacking
                internet access to prevent potential data leaks, retains full
                access to sensitive information. This dual-mode architecture
                ensures that sensitive information is isolated from external
                communication channels, enhancing overall system security.
              </p>

              <p>
                Since any communication over the public channel must be secure,
                it can be forwarded to the private channel, ensuring that both
                modes maintain the same state (Capizzi et al., 2008). However,
                there are instances when sensitive data must be transmitted
                across the internet, such as for authentication or registering
                for a new service. In these cases, the private channel allows
                for explicit forwarding of information via the public channel.
              </p>

              <p>
                One of these forms of shadow execution has been implemented in
                Haskell, leveraging its robust type system. Haskell's monads
                naturally support complex data types, ensuring data privacy by
                embedding the operating channel within the datatype (Schmitz et
                al., 2018). This is a clever solution for data segregation in
                application design. For instance, while application event
                logging is crucial, it can sometimes inadvertently include
                sensitive information that shouldn't be visible in the log. A
                smarter datatype that can infer its running mode could assist
                developers in designing secure applications.

                  Hard to implement for languages which do not have strong-type
                  systems. Python for example would have difficulties to
                  disallow access to private values, as python's type-system is
                  to flexible and is able to leak information (for example,
                  <code>object.__dict__</code> would just leak any details).

                  Virtually impossible to isolate external applications which
                  are not natively build around this feature. Building a whole
                  infrastructure with this technique will require alot of
                  effort.
