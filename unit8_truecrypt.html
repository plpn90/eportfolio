              <p>
                Full volume or partition encryption is a useful tool for
                protecting sensitive data by ensuring it is encrypted before
                being written to internal or external storage devices. This
                approach helps safeguard information in the event of physical
                theft of the storage medium. A variety of encryption tools exist
                - some integrated directly into the operating system, which
                eases the setup and experience (such as BitLocker or FileVault),
                while others, like VeraCrypt, are open-source solutions that
                provide greater flexibility and control over encryption
                settings.
              </p>

              <p>
                The process of encrypting and decrypting data relies on secure
                key management, typically initiated during system boot. There
                are several ways to retrieve the key:
              </p>

              <ul class="alt">
                <li>
                  Manual key entry offers no automation but introduces usability
                  concerns, such as forgotten passwords or weak key choices.
                </li>

                <li>
                  External key storage (e.g. USB dongle) provides convenience
                  but increases the risk of key loss or misplacement.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Trusted Platform Module (TPM) offers a robust, hardware-backed
                  approach to key storage. TPMs can securely generate and store
                  keys, and often support hardware-accelerated encryption,
                  easing the CPU workload and improving system performance. The
                  combination of TPM with a user-defined PIN is widely
                  considered a secure and efficient setup for disk encryption.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                An important aspect of TPM-based encryption is that the TPM chip
                is unique to each physical device, which means encryption keys
                are bound to the specific machine’s hardware (Roman et al.,
                2012). While this enhances security, it also introduces a key
                limitation: hard-disk migration is effectively impossible
                without recovery keys or decrypting the disk first. If the drive
                is moved to another machine, the encryption keys stored in the
                original TPM are no longer accessible, rendering the data
                unreadable.
              </p>

              <p>
                Unless specialised hardware is in-play - such as Apple Enclave,
                which is used by Apple’s FileVault encryption suite - systems
                must hold decryption keys in memory while running. This presents
                a vulnerability: tools designed to extract information from
                memory could potentially access these keys. As noted by Tan et
                al. (2020), this risk can be mitigated by disabling features
                like hibernation and virtual memory. However, such measures can
                degrade usability - especially disabling virtual memory
                (paging), which is essential for running large applications or
                multitasking on systems with limited RAM.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is also worth questioning whether full-disk encryption is
                necessary for every user. For many individuals, especially those
                using personal devices, the likelihood of targeted data theft
                through physical access is low. Additionally, cloud-based
                ecosystems (such as those used in Chromebooks) offload data
                storage to remote servers with built-in security measures,
                reducing the need for local disk encryption - albeit with the
                trade-off of requiring access to the internet.
              </p>

              <p>
                As a personal note, I would suggest using cloud providers to
                store critical information. Not only do clouds offer strong
                security, but they also provide additional benefits such as
                automatic backups, data recoverability, and high availability
                across devices. For many users, this approach offers a practical
                and reliable alternative to managing local disk encryption.
              </p>
