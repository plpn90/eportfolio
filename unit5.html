                <h1>Cyclomatic Complexity</h1>
              </header>
              <p>
                Cyclomatic complexity is a metric used to measure the complexity
                of software by plotting and counting the pathes of
                inter-dependent componentents throughout the source code.
                Developed by Thomas J. McCabe in 1976, this metric helps
                developers understand the structural complexity of their code,
                making it easier to identify areas that may be prone to
                maintainability concerns. Cyclomatic complexity is calculated by
                constructing a flowchart of the program, where nodes typically
                represent objects and edges represent flow paths (Kafura 2025).
                It is important to note that when J. McCabe introduced
                cyclomatic complexity in 1976, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
                was not yet widely adopted. The metric was originally designed
                to assess the complexity of procedures, and not objects (Kafura
                2025).
              </p>
              <p>
                A higher cyclomatic complexity indicates that a component has
                more decision branching-points, such as if statements, loops,
                and case statements, which can make the code harder to test and
                maintain. Conversely, a lower value suggests simpler, more
                straightforward code. By monitoring cyclomatic complexity, teams
                can set thresholds for acceptable complexity and prioritize
                refactoring efforts for overly complex modules.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although cyclomatic complexity reveals how interconnected a
                component is, it does not indicate whether this complexity is
                beneficial or problematic (Ebert 2016). In modern project
                management, where functions and objects are often organized into
                separate libraries, complexity frequently resides in the deeper
                branches of a project - within detailed implementations.
                Meanwhile, the true complexity may lie at the root level, where
                various components are integrated to form the actual system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my view, cyclomatic complexity alone does not provide a good
                picture of code quality. Good design principles, such as those
                found in SOLID, encourage developers to create well-structured,
                independent, and modular software, which has a greater impact on
                maintainability and robustness than complexity metrics alone. In
                particular, the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) from the
                SOLID framework states that high-level modules should not depend
                directly on low-level implementations, but should interact
                through interfaces (Joshi 2016). This approach promotes better
                design by making components more testable and flexible, as
                dependencies can be easily substituted during unit testing
                without requiring the full environment. Adopting good design
                principles leads to better maintainability and scalability,
                making cyclomatic complexity less critical.
