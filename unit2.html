                <h1>Implementing Hardened Systems with ISO/IEC 27000</h1>
              </header>

              <p>
                Safeguarding information assets extends beyond technological
                solutions; it necessitates the application of well-established
                principles and standards. The ISO/IEC 27000 series provides a
                comprehensive framework for the effective management of
                information security. However, it is critical to acknowledge
                that the weakest link of security is inherently the most
                vulnerable component - the human factor. With this context, I
                selected some key concepts which are helpful to mitigate the
                risks associated with human error.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Access control</b> is designed to ensure that only
                individuals with proper authorisation can access specific
                systems or data, thereby minimising the risk of both
                unintentional and intentional breaches. For example, role-based
                access control assigns permissions based on specific job
                responsibilities, ensuring that users only have access to the
                information necessary for their roles. Role-based access control
                also offers another advantage: it reduces the likelihood of
                errors during on- and off-boarding personal. This is because all
                the granted permissions are readily accessible in a single
                location, making it less likely that an ex-employee retains
                access beyond their employment period (Sutton 2022).
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Authentication</b> complements access control by verifying
                the identity of users attempting to gain access to systems.
                Common methods include passwords, biometric verification, and
                multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implementing strong
                authentication protocols significantly reduces the risk of
                unauthorised access and identity impersonation.
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Auditing</b> every action is essential for maintaining
                traceability and accountability within an organisation. By
                logging user activities and access events, organisations can
                detect irregularities and perform investigations of security
                incidents (Sutton 2022). Regular audits also contribute to the
                continuous improvement of the Information Security Management
                System (ISMS).
              </p>

              <p>
                <b>Confidentiality</b> is a core principle of information
                security, focusing on restricting data access to authorised
                personnel only. Techniques such as data encryption, secure
                communication protocols, and the enforcement of non-disclosure
                agreements are commonly employed to uphold data confidentiality
                (Mutch et al 2011).
              </p>

              <p>
                Lastly, <b>security implementation standards</b> provide a set
                of guidelines and controls necessary for translating security
                policies into actionable measures. Standards based on ISO/IEC
                27001, supported by ISO/IEC 27002, help organisations establish
                measurable, repeatable processes that can be systematically
                audited and refined for continuous enhancement.
