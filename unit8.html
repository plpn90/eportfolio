                Create a python program (you can use the Jupyter Notebooks
                space) that can take a text file and output an encrypted version
                as a file in your folder on the system. Demonstrate your program
                operation in this week's seminar session.

                The blog post on tutorialspoint.com primarily focuses on
                encoding techniques and weaker cryptographic methods. For
                symmetric encryption, it recommends DSA, which is outdated and
                less secure compared to Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). AES
                offers stronger security and performance, making it the
                preferred choice for modern encryption standards. It is widely
                adopted due to its robust resistance against cryptographic
                attacks, whereas DSA lacks the same level of reliability.
              </p>

              <p>
                It is essential to distinguish between encoding and encryption.
                Encoding, such as base64, is a method used to convert data into
                a different format for efficient transmission or storage. It
                does not provide security, as encoded data can be easily decoded
                without a key. In contrast, encryption is designed to secure
                data against unauthorised access by converting it into
                unreadable cipher text, which requires a decryption key to
                revert to its original form.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even though it is not an encryption, I selected base64 encoding
                for this activity due to its widespread use in transmitting
                binary data over human-readable channels.
              </p>

              <h4>Would it meet the GDPR regulations?</h4>
              <p>
                No, base64 is not suitable for encrypting sensitive data. In
                general, the GDPR does not explicitly mandate the use of
                specific cryptographic functions. A reasonable alternative would
                be to employ RSA for asymmetric cryptography and AES for
                symmetric cryptography.
